# Triggers list

> **Main article:** [Triggers](Triggers.md)


`/Crusader Kings III/game/triggers.log` is a documentation provided by the game, which contains all code triggers that can be used.

You can dump it locally on your computer by using the console command ``script_docs`` which will create it in `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/logs/`

The file needs to be generated again after each major patch to get the latest version.

The list is transcribed here, but be aware that it is outdated.
Some triggers have been deprecated, and some triggers added after launch are missing.
