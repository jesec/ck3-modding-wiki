# Effects

> **Note:** Last verified for version 1.7


An effect is a script command that changes the gamestate.

The full list of available code effects can be found in [effects_list](Effects_list.md).


## Effect blocks

Effects are executed in effect script blocks.

Those are either explicitly named so, like a decision's ``effect = { }`` block, or their name alludes to when the effect block is executed, like an event's ``immediate = { }`` block which is immediately executed when the event fires, even before the event window opens, by opposition to the event's ``after = { }`` block, which is executed after any event option has been picked.

Some effect blocks are executed when something else happens, like a character interaction's ``on_accept`` block, and must not be confused with [on_actions](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/on_actions).

In some cases, effects are used in hybrid blocks that accept effects amongst other things.
Ex: event options


```
option = {
   is_shown = { is_ai = yes }
   ai_will_do = { base = 100 }
   add_gold = 100
}
```

In this block, ``add_gold`` is the effect executed when the option is picked, but ``is_shown = { }`` is a trigger block and ``ai_will_do`` is an aI logic block.


## Effect syntax


### Code effects

Code effects have a predetermined syntax. They usually require a specific scope type context to work.

The console command script_docs dumps the effects.log, which contains the list of all existing code triggers, in Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\logs.

Code effects can take several forms:


#### Boolean form

Boolean effects are followed by ``= yes``.
The effect usually depends on the scope it is executed from, but otherwise it does not require any argument.

Ex: this effect releases the current character scope from prison.


```
release_from_prison = yes
```


#### Simple form

Simple effects require a single argument, provided on the right hand side of the ``=`` sign.

The argument can be:
* a scope
Ex: this effect makes the target scope the spouse of the current character scope


```
marry = scope:bride
```

* a database key
Ex: this effect changes the prison type of the current character scope

```
change_prison_type = house_arrest
```

* a numerical value
Ex: this effect adds the specified amount of gold to the current character scope

```
add_gold = 1000
```


#### Complex form

Complex effects use several parameters in a script block. Those parameters can be a boolean, a scope, a database key, a numerical value or a flag value.

Ex: this effects makes the target character, provided as a saved scope, a prisoner of the current character scope, and places them in house arrest.

```
imprison= {
  target = scope:imprisoned_character
  type = house_arrest
}
```


Some code effects have both a simple form and a complex form.


## scripted_effects

Scripted_effects are macros that enable replacing an assortment of effects with a single statement, to make script more legible and avoid repetition.

They are defined in common/scripted_effects, and can be used anywhere effects are allowed.

A scripted_effect can use other scripted_effects, but recursion is not allowed.


### Simple form

Simple scripted_effects execute a predetermined set of effects.

Ex: if the following set of effects are repeatedly used to give a character gold, prestige and piety:

```
add_gold = 1000
add_prestige = 1000
add_piety = 1000
```

instead of repeating the same set of triggers in different places, they can be defined as a scripted_effect:

```
give_gold_prestige_piety = {
   add_gold = 1000
   add_prestige = 1000
   add_piety = 1000
}
```

and anywhere that set of effects needs to be executed, it can be replaced by the following statement:

```
give_gold_prestige_piety = yes
```


Because scripted_effects can be used in a variety of different contexts, it is advised not to use in their definition ambiguous event targets such as ``root`` or ``prev``.


### Complex form

Scripted_effects can also have a complex form that handles literal text replacement, allowing to pass arguments.

Ex: if the following set of effects are repeatedly used to give a character gold, prestige and piety:


```
add_gold = 1000
add_prestige = 1000
add_piety = 1000
```

that set of triggers can be defined as a scripted_effect, but instead of using a specific value for those effects, the scripted_effect uses an argument defined in uppercase letters wrapped in two $ signs:

```
give_gold_prestige_piety = {
   add_gold = $VALUE$
   add_prestige = $VALUE$
   add_piety = $VALUE$
}
```

When used, the complex form of the scripted_effect specifies what the expected argument is, by using the same name but without the $ signs:

```
give_gold_prestige_piety = { VALUE = 1000 }
```


With that form, every occurrence of $VALUE$ in the scripted_effect will be *literally* replaced with the argument provided: the text replacement happens *before* the scripted_trigger is evaluated.
For this reason, caution is advised when using scripted_effect arguments to pass event targets or script_values, because their interpretation is contextual.

Ex: consider the following scripted_effect that makes a character give gold to another character:

```
give_gold = {
   $GIVER$ = {
      remove_short_term_gold = $VALUE$
      $TAKER$ = {
         add_gold = $VALUE$
      }
   }
}
```

If used like so from a character scope to make the father give money to the mother:

```
give_gold = {
   GIVER = father
   TAKER = mother
   VALUE = 1000
}
```

Text replacement being literal means that the scripted_effect will be interpreted as such:

```
give_gold = {
   father = {
      remove_short_term_gold = 1000
      mother = {
         add_gold = 1000
      }
   }
}
```

So the character receiving the money is not the intended character.

To avoid such issues, arguments in scripted_effects can be saved as scopes within the scripted_effect itself, before doing any context switch.

```
give_gold = {
   $GIVER$ = { save_scope_as = giver }
   $TAKER$ = { save_scope_as = taker }
   save_scope_value_as = {
      name = gold_amount
      value = $VALUE$
   }
   scope:giver = {
      remove_short_term_gold = scope:gold_amount
      scope:taker = {
         add_gold = scope:gold_amount
      }
   }
   clear_saved_scope = giver
   clear_saved_scope = taker
}
```

Since that will always be between -20 and 20 (unless you do something very unusual), and typically in a more narrow range than that, we should stick to those ranges.<br>Only use larger weights if you want the duel_value to have a smaller impact on the weighting, and only use smaller weights if you want the duel_value to have a huge impact on the weighting.<br>In addition, it is fully possible for the compare_modifier to reduce the weight to 0, which would mean that it will not be possible to happen at all. I've requested code support to make it so that we can define min and max values for weights, but until further notice we should use ranges that are guaranteed to not hit 0, or include min values in the compare_modifier itself.<br>Lastly, remember that if you want the outcome of a duel to scale linearly from (almost) 0% to (almost) 100%, the duel_value should be applied 50% to the good outcome, and -50% to the bad outcome. If you only apply it on one side, you will retain a (presumably significant) chunk of chance for the other outcome.</code></pre> | none |  |

## Extracted Code Blocks

<a id="code-block-1"></a>
### Code Block 1

```json
save_event_target_as = flag - save the character as an event target
save_temporary_event_target_as = flag - save the character as a temporary event target
name = 
age = 
gender = male/female/character scope
gender_female_chance = script_value - Range (0..100)
opposite_gender = character scope
trait = add this trait
random_traits_list = { count = { 1 5 } traitID = { some triggers } traitID = { some triggers } } - A number of traits specified by count (1 if not specified) will be picked from the traits that have their triggers met. Scopes are the same as where create_character is used. More than one grouping like this can be defined 
random_traits = yes/no
health = 
fertility = 
mother = 
father = 
real_father = (should only be set if the real father is not the same as father=)
employer = will end up in this court, will become a pool character unless specified or father/mother is landed
location = pool province; mutually exclusive with employer
template_character = 
faith, culture and dynasty are set from 1. template_character 2. father 3. mother 4. employer (not employer for dynasty) unless specified directly
faith = faith tag OR a faith scope
random_faith = { catholic = { some triggers } cathar = { some triggers }. Random one where the triggers are met will be picked. Scopes are the same as where create_character is used 
random_faith_in_religion = religion tag OR a faith scope (there's no religion scope)
culture = culture name OR a culture scope
random_culture = { norse = { some triggers } norwegian = { some triggers }. Random one where the triggers are met will be picked. Scopes are the same as where create_character is used 
random_culture_in_group = culture group name OR a culture scope (there's no group scope)
dynasty_house = dynasty house name OR a dynasty house scope
dynasty = generate/inherit/none - What to do if dynasty_house is not specified. generate by default.
martial/diplomacy/intrigue...  =  will get random unless specified
after_creation = { some effects } run after character is created. Scope starts off in the character, with the scope it was created in as PREV, and the same top scope and saved targets etc.
```

### Code Block 2

```json
Be aware that we make use of the current scopes implicitly. This is done in common/artifacts/visuals
name = dynamic description - artifact name
description = dynamic description - artifact description
rarity = enum - artifact rarity, ex. legendary
type = flag - inventory slot type, ex. trinket
modifier = static modifier - applied to the character whom wields this artifact
durability = script value - new durability, will be max by default
max_durability = script value - Optional. A value for the max durability, which would override the one normally assigned by the defines
decaying = yes/no - Optional. Set if artifact decays with time. Yes by default
history = artifact history entry - custom history entry to denote for example that this is artifact was reforged by someone else than the owner
   type = artifact history entry type - available types:
    created_before_history
    created
    discovered
    claimed_by_house
    given
    stolen
    inherited
    conquest
    taken_in_siege
    taken_in_battle
    won_in_duel
    reforged
template = artifact scripted template - a scripted base template with triggers and modifiers
visuals = artifact visual type - how this artifact should appear visually
generate_history = bool - automatically generate a new history entry if none has been scripted?
quality = script value - new quality, used in AI scoring
wealth = script value - new wealth, used in AI scoring
creator = character scope - set a custom creator of the artifact ( default is the owner )
visuals_source = scope containing landed title, dynasty or house - set a source of coat of arms graphics for the artifact 
(only few artifact models actually make use of it. Most notable - banners)
 save_scope_as = new artifact - an optional way to get a reference to the newly created artifact
title_history = title - history entries of the given title will be added to the artifact history
title_history_date = game date - from which date onwards to copy historical entries from given title
creator = character scope - set a custom creator of the artifact ( default is the owner )
```
