# Scopes list

`/Crusader Kings III/game/event_scopes.log` is a documentation provided by the game, which contains all existing scope types.

`/Crusader Kings III/game/event_targets.log` is a documentation provided by the game, which contains all existing event targets.

You can dump them locally on your computer by using the console command ``script_docs`` which will create them in `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/logs/`

The files need to be generated again after each major patch to get the latest version.

Both lists are transcribed here, but be aware that this information is outdated.
Some event targets have been deprecated, and some new scope types and event targets have been added since launch.

## Primitive scopes

These scope types by default have no direct scope links out of them, though they can chain into script values.


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | **Example** |
| Number | -1.0, 42, 69, some_script_value |
| Bool | yes/no |
| Flags | flag:some_flag |


    - Note: If you give a number more than five decimals, it fails** and the script engine reads the whole number as 0.

Technical information: the Number type (also called Value) is a signed 64 bit fixed point number with 5 digits after the decimal point. This means it can hold numbers from -92 233 720 368 547.75808 to 92 233 720 368 547.75807 (so about 100 trillion). However, the GUI display of these numbers is limited to values from -2 147 483 648.99999 to 2 147 483 647.99999 (so about 2 billion). In addition, by default the GUI will only print 2 digits after the decimal point. You can change this in ``common/modifier_definition_formats``.
